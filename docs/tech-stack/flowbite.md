# Flowbite

Flowbite is a UI component library built on Tailwind CSS that provides pre-designed components for building modern web applications. This guide will help you integrate Flowbite with React.

## Installation

To use Flowbite with React, you need to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install flowbite-react flowbite
```

Make sure you have Tailwind CSS set up in your project. If you haven’t installed Tailwind yet, follow these steps:

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then, update tailwind.config.js to include Flowbite:

```
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./node_modules/flowbite-react/**/*.js",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require('flowbite/plugin')],
};
```

## Configuration

Ensure Tailwind is included in your CSS file (src/index.css or src/global.css):

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Using Flowbite Components

You can now use Flowbite React components in your project. Import and use them as needed:

```
import { Button } from 'flowbite-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <Button color="blue" onClick={() => alert('Hello Flowbite!')}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Customizing Styles

Flowbite components follow Tailwind CSS utility classes, making customization easy. You can extend styles using Tailwind’s utility-first approach:

```
<Button className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

You can also override default styles by modifying your tailwind.config.js.

## Conclusion

Integrating Flowbite with React enhances your project with ready-to-use UI components, reducing development time. With Tailwind CSS, you can customize components easily to match your design requirements.
